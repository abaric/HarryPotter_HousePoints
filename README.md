UPDATE-_HOUSEPOINTS
===================

This is a more recent version of my House Points app. 

My school launched a House Points System (based on Harry Potter) last year to increase school spirit and encourage 
the Honor Code. My app allows teachers to log in and virtually add and subtract points. I am working on integrating
the app with my school's servers by working with the technology office here, but now I am experimenting with a local 
server/web framework called web2py that allows me to update and fetch data like current point values.
