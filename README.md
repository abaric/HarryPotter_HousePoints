UPDATE-_HOUSEPOINTS
===================

This is a more recent version of my House Points app. 

My high school launched a House Points System (based on Harry Potter) in 2013 to increase school spirit and encourage 
the Honor Code. My app allows teachers to log in and virtually add and subtract points. I worked on integrating
the app with my school's servers by working with the technology office there, but am now experimenting with a local 
server/web framework called web2py that allows me to update and fetch data such as current point values.
