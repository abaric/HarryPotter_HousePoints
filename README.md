My high school launched a House Points System (based on Harry Potter) in 2013 to increase school spirit and encourage 
the Honor Code. My iPhone app allows teachers to log in and virtually add and subtract points. I worked on integrating
the app with my school's servers by working with the Technology Office, and experimented with a web framework called web2py (built in server) that allowed  me to update and fetch data such as current point values.
